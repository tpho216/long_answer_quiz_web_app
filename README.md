# long_answer_quiz_web_app

# What's this about?
This is a Django application that is based on an example created by Vitor Freitas blog post about how to implement multiple user types. 

In this application, users can sign up as a student or a teacher. 
Teachers can create quizzes and students can answer quizzes based on their interests. 

My feature application will deal more specifically onto how to implement a long answer quiz that will give right or wrong answer 
based on the key words that the answer contains. 

I needed to borrow the example Django application to quickly implement this nicely TeeHee
